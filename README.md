[Try it!](https://ajc5.github.io/adaptive-quiz/)

An adaptive quiz app that supercharges your self-learning experience by letting you answer questions from different topics and at different difficulty levels. Earn qualifications as you gain new skills. Data is sourced directly from Wikidata. 

Buttons:
- right - next question from the same topic
- left - a question from a new topic
- top - a harder game
- bottom - an easier game

Game levels (default game):
- Level 1 - flashcard (answer is shown after a few seconds)
- Level 2 - true/false
- Level 3 - multiple choice
- Level 4 - fill in the blank

At all game levels answering the question correctly scores you a point and takes you to the next question from the same topic (like pressing right button).
